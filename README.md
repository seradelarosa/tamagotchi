## Project Description

This project is a fun browser version of the classic handheld Tamagotchi game. Take care of your Tamagotchi pet; feed them, play with them, and give them gifts to keep them happy! Keep your pet happy for a full day rotation and progress to the next day. Future improvements will allow the user to collect points from progressing in the game, and a shop page to exchange those points for cosmetic items, more food options, new toys and even additional rooms in your Tamagotchi house!
